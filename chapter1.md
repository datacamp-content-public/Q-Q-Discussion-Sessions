- Open the [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IsyrFoKTCBpAOPnkdrwmHZnse6psvvZ1HCXyIaV50Jo/edit?usp=sharing) we will use to track you results.
- Copy the two times you got (congruent and incongruent) into appropriate columns.
- Don't forget to put your name there as well. (you can use a nickname, just don't leave the field empty)

Have you managed to do the test and write down the results?
